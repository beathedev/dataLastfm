<h1>LastFM Data</h1>
The project is a data analysis tool that uses the Last.fm API to fetch data about the songs listened to by a user. Using this data, the tool generates a bar graph showing the most listened songs by the user. The graph is interactive and can be customized with different colors and labels. Overall, the project provides an easy way to visualize the most listened songs by a user on their Last.fm profile.
